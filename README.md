# NextJS Coming Soon Template

This is a simple coming soon template built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It is a lightweight and responsive template that can be used for various projects that require a "coming soon" page.


## Getting Started

Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/v1ct0rbr/nextjs-comming-soon.git`

Install dependencies: `npm install`

Rename coopy .env.example to .env

Start the development server: `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
